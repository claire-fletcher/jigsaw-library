# Jigsaw Library

This library is used to track jigsaws by adding and removing them. This will also have the ability to store specific information and "lend" them to borrowers. 

The project will be hosted locally with a backend server, database, and a frontend web app. 

The jigsaws will also be able to be scanned in and out of the library using their barcodes with the app able to read the barcode numbers already on them and then register them.
