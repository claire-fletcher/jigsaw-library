# Jigsaw Library

This library is used to track jigsaws by adding and removing them. This will also have the ability to store specific information and "lend" them to borrowers. 

The project will be hosted locally with a backend server, database, and a frontend web app. 

The jigsaws will also be able to be scanned in and out of the library using their barcodes with the app able to read the barcode numbers already on them and then register them.


### Poetry
- only being used to handle dependencies

## Dependencies

- currently will require a local mysql instance

# Plans
- Wanting to practice a Python backend with a basic frontend
- However, this is also simple enough to be attempted with just client-side typescript processing and potentially the in-built browser DB
  Which we could then adjust to be remote storage so the app could be accessed anywhere on the local network later.
- I may still go ahead with the backend being the focus to begin with and then move onto the alternative approach.
